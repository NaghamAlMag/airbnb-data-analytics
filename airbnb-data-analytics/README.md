## Find the perfect place to stay in Texas!
The aim of this homework consists in analyzing the text of Airbnb property listings and building a search engine. But what is AirBnb? It’s the world’s biggest accommodation-sharing site. How does Airbnb work? Read our work!

You can download the data here! 
[Here's a direct link to that data set we used.](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/airbnb-property-data-from-texas/downloads/Airbnb_Texas_Rentals.csv/1)


### In this repository you can find..

- HW_3.ipynb 
Our markdown written with all our considerations, we are not professionals, and with the tools we have created a search engine  of our own.

- Mappa.png or https://naghamalmag.github.io/
The map is not visible from our markdown, so we decided to upload it separately, so you can view the html page of our map, by going to this url https://naghamalmag.github.io/ , where you can see the map and when you press on any house's location you will see its price, or you can view the map image "Mappa.png".
